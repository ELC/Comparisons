# Description
This is a comparison for a variety of online IDEs. Using a typical scenario, pros and cons will be evaluated.

If you want to read just the conclusion you can go [here](#conclusion)

Do not forget to read the contributing file before create issues and pull requests

## Scenario
Online IDEs are usually used for scripting and small projects. Since other technologies are often used in specific scenarios we will focus on a single developer or a small teams of developers.

This is based on the tendency to scripting languages such as:
- JavaScript
- Python
- PHP
- Ruby

These are 4 scripting languages from the Top 6 most active repositories on Github* so this may imply in some way that focusing on little projects and small teams is closer to the general scenario

    Only completely free of charge IDE will be consider, not necessarily being them open-source or free software

The following scenarios have time-tested solutions:
- Systems Administrators: use software installed by default in every server such as vim or nano
- Large companies ecosystems: use software specified by the company politics
- University enviroment: use software provided by the university
- Large projects: use time-tested desktop IDE such as Visual Studio, Eclipse, ItelliJ, PyCharm

## Evaluated features:
- Colaborative editting: Several people editing the same file online
- Share Link: Generation of a link to a specific file
- Storage: All the files are stored in the cloud
- Project-Like: You can manage different files and folders
- Theme: Ergonomic theme for long-time training and fontsize customization
- Debbuging: Builtin debuger
- No Registrarion: No registration is needed
- Multiple Languages: Support for several programming languages
- Console: Has a builtin console to test the code
- No Reload: The possibility to run the code without reloading the page
- Keybinding: Vim, Emacs, Sublime keybindings support
- Chat: Builtin chat
- Source Control: Provide a transparent integration with any source control platform

## Disqualified
The following IDEs weren't included in the list for several reasons:

### Non-free:
* [Cloud 9](https://c9.io) Needs credit card to sing up

### Too complex for our Scenario:
The following are IDEs too complex for the given scenario, all of them use workstations, although some might be useful for a more complex scenario.
* [Codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com): You can't run and compile individual files
* [Nitrous](https://www.nitrous.io): It has total amount of hours limitations
* [Codetasty](https://codetasty.com): You can't run and compile individual files
* [Codenvy](https://codenvy.io): You can't run and compile individual files
* [Koding](https://koding.com): Uses stacks arquitechture

### Too basic to our Scenario
* [Codepad](https://codepad.co): Just store code as text with syntax
* [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com): Has no editor

## Conclusion
Despite depending on the team requirements, it seems to me that the best choice is a combination of [Kobra](https://kobra.io) and [Repl](https://repl.it/) because these two combined provided both, the colaborative features and the Console and Record, having dark themes, storage, keybindings and no registration required.
