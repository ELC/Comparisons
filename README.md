## Structure
Every comparison has:

- Description
- Index with hyperlinks
- Scenario chosen for the analisis
- Set of features to be considered
- Any prior requirement to be evalutated*
- List of candidates
- Evaluation
- Summary by feature
- Summary Table

\* For example in a freeware only comparison, paid software will be list but not evaluated. This is so because the user should know all the options avaiable even if some are not evaluated.
